## E-Commerce Platform
This project aims to create an E-Commerce platform with Product Catalog and Shopping Cart services. It involves the implementation of both front-end and back-end functionalities using React JS with Typescript for the front-end and .NET Core for the back-end. The database will be designed using MySQL or SQL Server. Additionally, there is an optional task to set up the application on a cloud platform and configure a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps.

Functional Requirement Overview
The project is divided into several tasks, each focusing on different aspects of the system. The deliverables for each task are described below:

Front-end: React JS
Task: Implement the front-end for the Product Catalog and Shopping Cart functionalities using React JS with Typescript. NextJS knowledge is a plus.
Deliverable: A .zip file with the front-end application's source code. Include a README file explaining how to run and test the application.
Backend: .NET Core
Task: Implement the backend for the Product Catalog and Shopping Cart services using .NET Core repository pattern. Show good understanding of dependency injection, middlewares, LINQ, and Entity Framework (both Code First and Database First approaches). Implement CRUD for products and a POST method for the order.
Deliverable: A .zip file containing the source code of the services. Include a README file with build and run instructions.
Database Design
Task: Design the database schema for the system using MySQL or SQL Server. Optimize LINQ expressions and consider other important aspects of database design.
Deliverable: A .zip file containing the database schema, EF model classes, and the LINQ queries for data access.
(BONUS) Cloud and DevOps
Task: Set up the application on Azure or AWS cloud, using their own cloud service if preferred. Configure a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps for continuous integration, testing, and deployment.
Deliverable: Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository. Include a brief document outlining the steps taken to set up the CI/CD pipeline and deploy the app on the cloud.
